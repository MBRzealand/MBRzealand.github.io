### Less Brief introduction:
Hello, I'm Mikkel Boye Rasmussen, former math student and hence already know a little  
programming. I have experience with the programs/languages: Maple, R-studio(R-markdown), ruby, javascript and python.
Currently my sleep schedule is about as reliable as the McDonalds icecream machines, I recently got a puppy, so if I look upset.. I'm either sleepy.. or you know... upset..   Generally i tend to have a very positive outlook on life, however immense amounts of sarcasm and self-irony might make this difficult to believe.

### Longer Jokes

1. A Chinese doctor can't find a job in a hospital in the US, so he opens a clinic  
and puts a sign outside that reads "*GET TREATMENT FOR $20 - IF NOT CURED GET BACK $100.*"  
An American lawyer thinks this is a great opportunity to earn $100 and goes to the clinic.  
**Lawyer:** "*I have lost my sense of taste.*"  
**Chinese:** "*Nurse, bring medicine from box No. 22 and put 3 drops in patient's mouth.*"  
**Lawyer:** "*Ugh. this is kerosene.*"  
**Chinese:** "*Congrats, your sense of taste is restored. Give me $20.*"  
The annoyed lawyer goes back after a few days to recover his money.  
**Lawyer:** "*I have lost my memory. I cannot remember anything.*"  
**Chinese:** "*Nurse, bring medicine from box no. 22 and put 3 drops in his mouth.*"  
**Lawyer (annoyed):** "*This is kerosene. You gave this to me last time for restoring my taste.*"  
**Chinese:** "*Congrats. You got your memory back. Give me $20.*"  
The fuming lawyer pays him, and then comes back a week later determined to get back $100.  
**Lawyer:** "*My eyesight has become very weak I can't see at all.*"  
**Chinese:** "*Well, I don't have any medicine for that, so take this $100.*"  
**Lawyer (staring at the note):** "*But this is $20, not $100!!*"  
**Chinese:** "*Congrats, your eyesight is restored. Give me $20*"
